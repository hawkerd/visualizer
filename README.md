# Visualizer README

## Overview

The Visualizer is a C++ application designed to provide a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms. Utilizing modern graphics libraries like GLFW, GLEW, and OpenGL, it offers a rich, interactive visual experience that allows intuition building.

## Features

- **Graphical Rendering**: Leverages OpenGL for high-performance graphics rendering.
- **Library Integration**: Uses GLFW and GLEW for window management and OpenGL function handling, respectively. Uses ImGui to provide a graphical user interface.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Capable of handling different types of data for visualization.
- **Modular Structure**: Source files, object files, and executables are organized into separate directories.
