# Visualizer README

## Overview

The Visualizer is a C++ application designed to provide a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms. Utilizing modern graphics libraries like GLFW, GLEW, and OpenGL, it offers a rich, interactive visual experience that allows intuition building.

## Features

- **Graphical Rendering**: Leverages OpenGL for high-performance graphics rendering.
- **Library Integration**: Uses GLFW and GLEW for window management and OpenGL function handling, respectively.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Capable of handling different types of data for visualization.
- **Modular Structure**: Source files, object files, and executables are organized into separate directories.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- GCC Compiler (with support for C++11)
- GLFW, GLEW, and OpenGL libraries
- Freetype library (for font rendering)

## Building and Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Obtain a copy of the source code from the project's repository.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the command `make run` from the root directory. This will start the application.
