# visualizer

This is an algorithm visualizer for sorting methods. It uses OpenGL to render bars, which represent elements of the list, and continues rendering them throughout the sorting process

To compile and run:
- Make sure you have glew and glfw libraries installed on your computer, and edit the makefile Include and Library paths to find them. On most computers, if installed normally, they should already be in the correct directories, and no modification is required.
- run 'make' and then run the generated executable using  './visualizer'
